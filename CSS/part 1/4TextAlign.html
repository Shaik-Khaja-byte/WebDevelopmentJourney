    <h2>Fictional character biography</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Phastos's history is very murky. He is a third or fourth generation Eternal 
        who chose to remain on Earth because of his obsessive search for an unidentified 
        item or person.[volume & issue needed] He continues to serve as the master technologist 
        of the Eternal race, and it was his genius which allowed Virako to return from apparent death.
        Although he despises war, Phastos chose to follow Ikaris into battle against the minions of Apocalypse.[2]
        Phastos is shown living under the name Phillip Stoss,[3] before having his real identity revealed to him.
