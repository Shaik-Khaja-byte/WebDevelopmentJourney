# WebDevelopmentJourney

This repository documents my **structured learning journey in web development**, following a clear progression from fundamentals to hands-on projects.

## Learning Path
- **HTML** – Core structure, semantics, forms, tables, and accessibility-focused markup
- **CSS** – Layouts, positioning, flexbox, responsive design, and visual styling
- **JavaScript** – Core language concepts, DOM manipulation, and interactive logic

## Projects
- **Spotify Clone (HTML + CSS)**  
  Built at the end of the CSS phase to strengthen layout, styling, and responsiveness skills.

- **Simon Says Game (JavaScript)**  
  Built at the end of the JavaScript phase to apply logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

Project files can be explored directly through the folder structure.

## Ongoing Progress
This repository will continue to be updated as I advance further in my web development journey and build more projects.
